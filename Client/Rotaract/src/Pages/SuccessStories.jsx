                        Under the guidance of Tejo Murthy, our Rotaract Club successfully conducted an impactful project at Savanadurga.
                        We cleared over 250 kg of waste, promoting environmental awareness among trekkers and locals.
                        More than 100 volunteers united to restore the natural beauty of the area.
                        The project inspired a strong message of sustainability and community responsibility
